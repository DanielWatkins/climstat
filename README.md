Robust statistics for climate data

climstat is (to be) a Python library containing implementations of robust statistics useful for climate data analysis. The initial motivation was to have access to the statistical tools described in the paper "Resistant, robust, and Non-parametric Techniques for the Analysis of CLimate Data" by John R. Lazante (International Journal of CLimatology, 16, pp. 1197-1226, 1996).

climstat is for Python 3 and depends on Numpy and Scipy.stats
Currently, I am using Numpy 1.10.4, Scipy 0.18.1, and Python 3.4.5.
